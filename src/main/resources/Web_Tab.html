<h1>"Web" Tab</h1>
<p>This tab is used to get input manuscript text from a web source. <br />The web source currently used is <a href="http://www.voynich.nu/">http://www.voynich.nu/</a></p>
<p>On this web source, Voynich manuscript pages are collected in quires that contain varying amount of pages in them. Pages are marked with a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">number</span> <strong>and</strong> a layout assigning <span style="text-decoration: underline;">letter <strong>r</strong> or <strong>v</strong></span>. The pages also have several differing transcriptions that can be discerned by their code symbol/letter.</p>
<h3>Possible issues with source text</h3>
<p>Please note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some pages are missing from queries or are not transliterated;</li>
<li>Some page naming is inconsistent, therefore, cannot be properly loaded;</li>
<li>Not all transcription versions are available for all the pages;</li>
<li>Several pages contain special untranscribed symbols (usually identifiable by inclusion in curly brackets {} ).</li>
</ul>
<p>In case of an issue with getting source text, a popup window explains the cause of this problem.</p>
<p>Please refer to the website (<a href="http://www.voynich.nu/">http://www.voynich.nu/)&nbsp;</a> for additional context and source insight.</p>
