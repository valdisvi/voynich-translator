# Voynich Transliterator

### Overview
This project's source code is for a Voynich Manuscript transliteration application. It is used to simplify and automate the transliteration process by quickly getting the transcription of the page and applying different table transliterations to text generated from user input or an online source. 
Users can create custom transliteration tables and apply their rules to the generated text, as well as use the provided default tables. 
The web source for getting transcribed pages is http://voynich.nu/

### Features

- Text transliteration
- Font change (Manuscript/Latin)
- Custom transliteration tables 
- Load transcribed pages from a web source 
  - Pick different transcription versions

### General improvements 

- More intuitive, user-friendlier design
- Possible to get transcriptions of most quires and pages of the manuscript
  - Additional buttons and page support added
- Documentation added
- User manual added to the application
- No more JavaFX dependencies

For improvements and fixes of an inherited JavaFX dependant project, please refer to [Source Investigation.md](https://github.com/beatrise/voynich-translator/blob/master/sourceInvestigation.md) file

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. ?See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.?

### Prerequisites
To run inherited project class files with JavaFX dependencies you have to install Java FX libraries:
```
sudo apt-get install openjfx openjfx-source
```
For JavaFX development use [e(fx)clipse](https://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html) or other tool, which supports Java FX development environment.

For simplifying Swing GUI development we recommend you use [WindowBuilder plugin](https://www.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/) or a similar tool.

### Installing
