# Voynich Transliterator

### Overview
This project's source code is for a Voynich Manuscript transliteration application. It is used to simplify and automate the transliteration process by quickly getting the transcription of the page and applying different table transliterations to text generated from user input or an online source. 
Users can create custom transliteration tables and apply their rules to the generated text, as well as use the provided default tables. 
The web source for getting transcribed pages is http://voynich.nu/

### Features

- Text transliteration
- Custom transliteration tables
- Load transcribed pages from a web source
  - Pick different transcription versions
